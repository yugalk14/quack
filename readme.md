# Quack - A Twitter Clone
This is my running live application on cloud (Microsoft Azure), its a Twitter Clone called Quack using MEAN Stack.
I've used **MEAN stack -- Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node** to make this project.
I Created a dynamic front end by using the Angular.js front end framework Run an server-side application with authentication services on Node.js Model and store data in MongoDB Build an API using Express and deploy it all on **Microcosft Azure!**

**Microcosft Azure!** provides the analytics of the web application such as 
-Data in, Data out 
-Errors if its happening 
-Number of requests happening on the web application 
-Average response time of the application.

I've used **Passport.js** for user login authentication. For user's password security I've used **bcrypt.js** to hash the password. So that unauthenticated personal can't see what is the particular user password not even Admin (me).

**mLab** have been used to store the data viz. username, hashed password, posts, time.

Have a look into this application, its a light Twitter clone where you can quack!(Tweet).
